# 09 Delete an article
As a user, I want to be able to delete an article that I'm currently viewing

* **GIVEN** the user is on a view article page
* **WHEN** they click on a delete button
* **THEN** a confirm modal should pop up asking if they are sure that they want to delete the article




* **GIVEN** a confirm delete modal is being displayed
* **WHEN** the user clicks *yes*
* **THEN** the article should be deleted
* **AND** the pop up will disappear
* **AND** the page will redirected back to the home page




* **GIVEN** a confirm delete modal is being displayed
* **WHEN** the user clicks *no* 
* **THEN** the pop up will disappear




* **GIVEN** the user has clicked *yes* on the confirm modal
* **WHEN** an error occurs 
* **THEN** nothing should happend
